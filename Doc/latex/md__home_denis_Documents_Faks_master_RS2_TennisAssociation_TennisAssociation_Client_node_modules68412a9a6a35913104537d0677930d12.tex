\href{http://npm.im/mkdirp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily mkdirp}}}, but chown to the owner of the containing folder if possible and necessary.

That is, on Windows and when running as non-\/root, it\textquotesingle{}s exactly the same as \href{http://npm.im/mkdirp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily mkdirp}}}.

When running as root on non-\/\+Windows systems, it uses \href{http://npm.im/infer-owner}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily infer-\/owner}}} to find the owner of the containing folder, and then \href{http://npm.im/chownr}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily chownr}}} to set the ownership of the created folder to that same uid/gid.

This is used by \href{http://npm.im/npm}{\texttt{ npm}} to prevent root-\/owned files and folders from showing up in your home directory (either in {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} or in the {\ttfamily $\sim$/.npm} cache) when running as root.
