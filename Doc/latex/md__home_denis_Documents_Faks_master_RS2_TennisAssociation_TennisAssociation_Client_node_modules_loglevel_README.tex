Minimal lightweight simple logging for Java\+Script. loglevel replaces console.\+log() and friends with level-\/based logging and filtering, with none of console\textquotesingle{}s downsides.

This is a barebones reliable everyday logging library. It does not do fancy things, it does not let you reconfigure appenders or add complex log filtering rules or boil tea (more\textquotesingle{}s the pity), but it does have the all core functionality that you actually use\+:\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7825}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7825}

\item It works with all the standard Java\+Script loading systems out of the box (Common\+JS, AMD, or just as a global)
\item Logging is filtered to \char`\"{}warn\char`\"{} level by default, to keep your live site clean in normal usage (or you can trivially re-\/enable everything with an initial log.\+enable\+All() call)
\item Magically handles situations where console logging is not initially available (IE8/9), and automatically enables logging as soon as it does become available (when developer console is opened)
\item Type\+Script type definitions included, so no need for extra {\ttfamily @types} packages
\item Extensible, to add other log redirection, filtering, or formatting functionality, while keeping all the above (except you will clobber your stacktrace, see Plugins below)

If you\textquotesingle{}re using NPM, you can just run {\ttfamily npm install loglevel}.

Alternatively, loglevel is also available via \href{https://github.com/bower/bower}{\texttt{ Bower}} ({\ttfamily bower install loglevel}), as a \href{http://www.webjars.org/}{\texttt{ Webjar}}, or an \href{https://atmospherejs.com/spacejamio/loglevel}{\texttt{ Atmosphere package}} (for Meteor)

Alternatively if you just want to grab the file yourself, you can download either the current stable \href{https://raw.github.com/pimterry/loglevel/master/dist/loglevel.min.js}{\texttt{ production version}} or the \href{https://raw.github.com/pimterry/loglevel/master/dist/loglevel.js}{\texttt{ development version}} directly, or reference it remotely on unpkg at \href{https://unpkg.com/loglevel/dist/loglevel.min.js}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily https\+://unpkg.\+com/loglevel/dist/loglevel.\+min.\+js}}} (this will redirect to a latest version, use the resulting redirected URL if you want to pin that version).

loglevel is written as a UMD module, with a single object exported. Unfortunately ES6 module loaders \& transpilers don\textquotesingle{}t all handle this the same way. Some will treat the object as the default export, while others use it as the root exported object. In addition, loglevel includes {\ttfamily default} property on the root object, designed to help handle this differences. Nonetheless, there\textquotesingle{}s two possible syntaxes that might work for you\+:

For most tools, using the default import is the most convenient and flexible option\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{import log from 'loglevel';}
\DoxyCodeLine{log.warn("{}module-\/tastic"{});}

\end{DoxyCode}


For some tools though, it might better to wildcard import the whole object\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{import * as log from 'loglevel';}
\DoxyCodeLine{log.warn("{}module-\/tastic"{});}

\end{DoxyCode}


There\textquotesingle{}s no major difference, unless you\textquotesingle{}re using Type\+Script \& building a loglevel plugin (in that case, see \href{https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/149}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/149}}). In general though, just use whichever suits your environment, and everything should work out fine.\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7835}{}\doxysubsection{With no\+Conflict()\+:}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7835}
If you\textquotesingle{}re using another Java\+Script library that exposes a \textquotesingle{}log\textquotesingle{} global, you can run into conflicts with loglevel. Similarly to j\+Query, you can solve this by putting loglevel into no-\/conflict mode immediately after it is loaded onto the page. This resets to \textquotesingle{}log\textquotesingle{} global to its value before loglevel was loaded (typically {\ttfamily undefined}), and returns the loglevel object, which you can then bind to another name yourself.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<script src="{}loglevel.min.js"{}></script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{<script>}
\DoxyCodeLine{var logging = log.noConflict();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{logging.warn("{}still pretty easy"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{</script>}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7836}{}\doxysubsection{Type\+Script\+:}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7836}
loglevel includes its own type definitions, assuming you\textquotesingle{}re using a modern module environment (e.\+g. Node.\+JS, webpack, etc), you should be able to use the ES6 syntax above, and everything will work immediately. If not, file a bug!

If you really want to use Log\+Level as a global however, but from Type\+Script, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to declare it as such first. To do that\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create a {\ttfamily loglevel.\+d.\+ts} file
\item Ensure that file is included in your build (e.\+g. add it to {\ttfamily include} in your tsconfig, pass it on the command line, or use {\ttfamily ///$<$reference path=\char`\"{}./loglevel.\+d.\+ts\char`\"{} /$>$})
\item In that file, add\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{import * as log from 'loglevel';}
\DoxyCodeLine{export as namespace log;}
\DoxyCodeLine{export = log;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7837}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_README_autotoc_md7837}
The loglevel API is extremely minimal. All methods are available on the root loglevel object, which it\textquotesingle{}s suggested you name \textquotesingle{}log\textquotesingle{} (this is the default if you import it in globally, and is what\textquotesingle{}s set up in the above examples). The API consists of\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 5 actual logging methods, ordered and available as\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily log.\+trace(msg)}
\item {\ttfamily log.\+debug(msg)}
\item {\ttfamily log.\+info(msg)}
\item {\ttfamily log.\+warn(msg)}
\item {\ttfamily log.\+error(msg)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily log.\+log(msg)} is also available, as an alias for {\ttfamily log.\+debug(msg)}, to improve compatibility with {\ttfamily console}, and make migration easier.

Exact output formatting of these will depend on the console available in the current context of your application. For example, many environments will include a full stack trace with all trace() calls, and icons or similar to highlight other calls.

These methods should never fail in any environment, even if no console object is currently available, and should always fall back to an available log method even if the specific method called (e.\+g. warn) isn\textquotesingle{}t available.

Be aware that all this means that these method won\textquotesingle{}t necessarily always produce exactly the output you expect in every environment; loglevel only guarantees that these methods will never explode on you, and that it will call the most relevant method it can find, with your argument. For example, {\ttfamily log.\+trace(msg)} in Firefox before version 64 prints the stacktrace by itself, and doesn\textquotesingle{}t include your message (see \href{https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/84}{\texttt{ \#84}}).
\item A {\ttfamily log.\+set\+Level(level, \mbox{[}persist\mbox{]})} method.

This disables all logging below the given level, so that after a log.\+set\+Level(\char`\"{}warn\char`\"{}) call log.\+warn(\char`\"{}something\char`\"{}) or log.\+error(\char`\"{}something\char`\"{}) will output messages, but log.\+info(\char`\"{}something\char`\"{}) will not.

This can take either a log level name or \textquotesingle{}silent\textquotesingle{} (which disables everything) in one of a few forms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As a log level from the internal levels list, e.\+g. log.\+levels.\+SILENT ← {\itshape for type safety}
\item As a string, like \textquotesingle{}error\textquotesingle{} (case-\/insensitive) ← {\itshape for a reasonable practical balance}
\item As a numeric index from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent) ← {\itshape deliciously terse, and more easily programmable (...although, why?)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Where possible the log level will be persisted. Local\+Storage will be used if available, falling back to cookies if not. If neither is available in the current environment (i.\+e. in Node), or if you pass {\ttfamily false} as the optional \textquotesingle{}persist\textquotesingle{} second argument, persistence will be skipped.

If log.\+set\+Level() is called when a console object is not available (in IE 8 or 9 before the developer tools have been opened, for example) logging will remain silent until the console becomes available, and then begin logging at the requested level.
\item A {\ttfamily log.\+set\+Default\+Level(level)} method.

This sets the current log level only if one has not been persisted and can’t be loaded. This is useful when initializing scripts; if a developer or user has previously called {\ttfamily set\+Level()}, this won’t alter their settings. For example, your application might set the log level to {\ttfamily error} in a production environment, but when debugging an issue, you might call {\ttfamily set\+Level(\char`\"{}trace\char`\"{})} on the console to see all the logs. If that {\ttfamily error} setting was set using {\ttfamily set\+Default\+Level()}, it will still stay as {\ttfamily trace} on subsequent page loads and refreshes instead of resetting to {\ttfamily error}.

The {\ttfamily level} argument takes is the same values that you might pass to {\ttfamily set\+Level()}. Levels set using {\ttfamily set\+Default\+Level()} never persist to subsequent page loads.
\item {\ttfamily log.\+enable\+All()} and {\ttfamily log.\+disable\+All()} methods.

These enable or disable all log messages, and are equivalent to log.\+set\+Level(\char`\"{}trace\char`\"{}) and log.\+set\+Level(\char`\"{}silent\char`\"{}) respectively.
\item A {\ttfamily log.\+get\+Level()} method.

Returns the current logging level, as a number from 0 (trace) to 5 (silent)

It\textquotesingle{}s very unlikely you\textquotesingle{}ll need to use this for normal application logging; it\textquotesingle{}s provided partly to help plugin development, and partly to let you optimize logging code as below, where debug data is only generated if the level is set such that it\textquotesingle{}ll actually be logged. This probably doesn\textquotesingle{}t affect you, unless you\textquotesingle{}ve run profiling on your code and you have hard numbers telling you that your log data generation is a real performance problem.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{if (log.getLevel() <= log.levels.DEBUG) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  var logData = runExpensiveDataGeneration();}
\DoxyCodeLine{  log.debug(logData);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


This notably isn\textquotesingle{}t the right solution to avoid the cost of string concatenation in your logging. Firstly, it\textquotesingle{}s very unlikely that string concatenation in your logging is really an important performance problem. Even if you do genuinely have hard metrics showing that it is though, the better solution that wrapping your log statements in this is to use multiple arguments, as below. The underlying console API will automatically concatenate these for you if logging is enabled, and if it isn\textquotesingle{}t then all log methods are no-\/ops, and no concatenation will be done at all.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Prints 'My concatenated log message'}
\DoxyCodeLine{log.debug("{}My "{}, "{}concatenated "{}, "{}log message"{});}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\ttfamily log.\+get\+Logger(logger\+Name)} method.

This gets you a new logger object that works exactly like the root {\ttfamily log} object, but can have its level and logging methods set independently. All loggers must have a name (which is a non-\/empty string, or a \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol}{\texttt{ Symbol}}). Calling {\ttfamily get\+Logger()} multiple times with the same name will return an identical logger object.

In large applications, it can be incredibly useful to turn logging on and off for particular modules as you are working with them. Using the {\ttfamily get\+Logger()} method lets you create a separate logger for each part of your application with its own logging level.

Likewise, for small, independent modules, using a named logger instead of the default root logger allows developers using your module to selectively turn on deep, trace-\/level logging when trying to debug problems, while logging only errors or silencing logging altogether under normal circumstances.

Example usage $\ast$(using Common\+JS modules, but you could do the same with any module system)\+:$\ast$

\DoxyCodeLine{moduleOne.doSomethingAmazing();}
\DoxyCodeLine{moduleTwo.doSomethingSpecial();}
\DoxyCodeLine{// logs "{}Special message from module two."{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{// (but nothing from module one.)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Loggers returned by {\ttfamily get\+Logger()} support all the same properties and methods as the default root logger, excepting {\ttfamily no\+Conflict()} and the {\ttfamily get\+Logger()} method itself.

Like the root logger, other loggers can have their logging level saved. If a logger’s level has not been saved, it will inherit the root logger’s level when it is first created. If the root logger’s level changes later, the new level will not affect other loggers that have already been created. Loggers with Symbol names (rather than string names) will be always considered as unique instances, and will never have their logging level saved or restored.

Likewise, loggers will inherit the root logger’s {\ttfamily method\+Factory}. After creation, each logger can have its {\ttfamily method\+Factory} independently set. See the {\itshape plugins} section below for more about {\ttfamily method\+Factory}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\ttfamily log.\+get\+Loggers()} method.

This will return you the dictionary of all loggers created with {\ttfamily get\+Logger}, keyed off of their names.

Loglevel provides a simple reliable minimal base for console logging that works everywhere. This means it doesn\textquotesingle{}t include lots of fancy functionality that might be useful in some cases, such as log formatting and redirection (e.\+g. also sending log messages to a server over AJAX)

Including that would increase the size and complexity of the library, but more importantly would remove stacktrace information. Currently log methods are either disabled, or enabled with directly bound versions of the console.\+log methods (where possible). This means your browser shows the log message as coming from your code at the call to {\ttfamily log.\+info(\char`\"{}message!\char`\"{})} not from within loglevel, since it really calls the bound console method directly, without indirection. The indirection required to dynamically format, further filter, or redirect log messages would stop this.

There\textquotesingle{}s clearly enough enthusiasm for this even at that cost though that loglevel now includes a plugin API. To use it, redefine log.\+method\+Factory(method\+Name, log\+Level, logger\+Name) with a function of your own. This will be called for each enabled method each time the level is set (including initially), and should return a function to be used for the given log method, at the given level, for a logger with the given name. If you\textquotesingle{}d like to retain all the reliability and features of loglevel, it\textquotesingle{}s recommended that this wraps the initially provided value of {\ttfamily log.\+method\+Factory}

For example, a plugin to prefix all log messages with \char`\"{}\+Newsflash\+: \char`\"{} would look like\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var originalFactory = log.methodFactory;}
\DoxyCodeLine{log.methodFactory = function (methodName, logLevel, loggerName) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    var rawMethod = originalFactory(methodName, logLevel, loggerName);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return function (message) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        rawMethod("{}Newsflash: "{} + message);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{log.setLevel(log.getLevel()); // Be sure to call setLevel method in order to apply plugin}

\end{DoxyCode}


$\ast$(The above supports only a single log.\+warn(\char`\"{}\char`\"{}) argument for clarity, but it\textquotesingle{}s easy to extend to a \href{http://jsbin.com/xehoye/edit?html,console}{\texttt{ fuller variadic version}})$\ast$

If you develop and release a plugin, please get in contact! I\textquotesingle{}d be happy to reference it here for future users.
