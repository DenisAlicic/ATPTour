If you think we need to support another command, you can either make an issue requesting support, or just implement it yourself.

Adding new commands is easy. In \href{lib/index.ts}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily lib/index.\+ts}}}, you\textquotesingle{}ll see the implementation of our current commands. If your command is already supported by \href{https://github.com/admc/wd}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily wd}}}, you should be able to get all the information you need \href{https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/master/lib/protocol}{\texttt{ from {\ttfamily webdriverio}}}. Make sure to add tests in \href{spec/index_spec.ts}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily spec/index\+\_\+spec.\+ts}}}, and run {\ttfamily npm test} before you submit.
