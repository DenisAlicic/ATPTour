\item Features that can\textquotesingle{}t be meaningfully implemented in a cross-\/environment compatible manner won\textquotesingle{}t be implemented.
\item Please check the previously opened issues to see if somebody else has suggested it first.
\item Consider submitting a pull request to add the feature instead, if you\textquotesingle{}re confident it fits within the above
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you\textquotesingle{}re filing a bug, please remember\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}

If you\textquotesingle{}d like to help develop loglevel further, please submit a pull request! I\textquotesingle{}m very keen to improve loglevel further, and good pull requests will be enthusiastically merged.

Before submitting a pull request to fix a bug or add a new feature, please check the lists above to ensure it\textquotesingle{}ll be accepted. Browser compatibility is particularly important here; if you add a feature or fix a bug which breaks things on other browsers it will not be merged, no matter how awesome it may be.

To be more specific, before submitting your pull request please ensure\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You haven\textquotesingle{}t broken the existing test suite in any obvious browsers (at least check latest IE/\+FF/\+Chrome -\/ automatic saucelabs tests for this are coming soon too)
\item You\textquotesingle{}ve added relevant tests for the bug you\textquotesingle{}re fixing/the new feature you\textquotesingle{}re adding/etc, which pass in all the relevant browsers
\item JSHint is happy with your new code
\item You\textquotesingle{}ve updated the API docs (in README.\+md) to detail any changes you\textquotesingle{}ve made to the public interface
\item Your change is backward compatible (or you\textquotesingle{}ve explicitly said if it\textquotesingle{}s not; this isn\textquotesingle{}t great, but will be considered)
\item You haven\textquotesingle{}t changed any files in dist/ (these are auto-\/generated, and should only be changed on release)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7847}{}\doxysubsection{Project structure}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_loglevel_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7847}
The core project code is all in lib/loglevel.\+js, and this should be the only file you need to touch for functional changes themselves.

The released code is in dist/$\ast$.js, and should not be touched by anything except releases

The test suite is entirely in test/$\ast$.js\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Every file ending in \textquotesingle{}-\/test.\+js\textquotesingle{} is a unit test, is written in Require\+JS, and should pass in any environment
\item global-\/integration.\+js and node-\/integration.\+js are quick integration smoke tests for node and for browser global usage
\item test-\/helpers.\+js contains some test utilities
\item manual-\/test.\+html is a test page which includes the current loglevel build, so you can manually check it works in a given browser

\item Write some tests in /test for your change, as relevant
\item Make your code changes in /lib/loglevel.js
\item Check your code all passes (run {\ttfamily grunt}) -\/ if you have any issues try running {\ttfamily grunt jasmine\+:requirejs\+:src\+:build} (or a different test build instead of \textquotesingle{}requirejs\textquotesingle{}\+: see the jasmine config in Gruntfile.\+js) and debugging the generated \+\_\+\+Spec\+Runner.\+html in a browser
\item Commit your changes
\item Open a pull request back to master in loglevel
