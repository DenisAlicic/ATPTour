This folder contains a number of test cases which can also serve as usage examples.

Each folder contains a bog-\/standard Webpack project and an optional file {\ttfamily test.\+js} for more intricate tests.\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules4be3aa7967c2ad991b3caf64b30409c5_autotoc_md2577}{}\doxysection{Adding a Test Case}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules4be3aa7967c2ad991b3caf64b30409c5_autotoc_md2577}
In order to create a new test case, it\textquotesingle{}s probably best to start by copying an existing example. Simply copy the directory to a new name, then edit {\ttfamily README.\+md}, {\ttfamily webpack.\+config.\+js} and optionally {\ttfamily test.\+js}. You can run all examples using {\ttfamily yarn mocha}, or a specific example using `yarn mocha -\/-\/grep \textquotesingle{}titlehere'\`{}.

The simplest kind of example is an end-\/to-\/end test. This is just a vanilla Webpack project\+: a {\ttfamily webpack.\+config.\+js} and any files that you want to bundle. To pass a test, such an example should provide an {\ttfamily index.\+html} and use {\ttfamily console.\+log} somewhere to output {\ttfamily ok} when loaded in a web browser. To fail, it should output {\ttfamily error}. (If it doesn\textquotesingle{}t output either {\ttfamily ok} or {\ttfamily error} it will time out.)

However, end-\/to-\/end tests are also the slowest performing and aren\textquotesingle{}t well suited to examining the Webpack build output. For your case it might be better to add a file {\ttfamily test.\+js} with contents as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For examining only webpack build output, export a function {\ttfamily check} with one argument {\ttfamily stats}\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{module.exports.check = function check(stats) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The function should examine stats and throw in case of error. It can also return a promise.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For examining Webpack build output with a web server serving the output spun up, add another argument {\ttfamily url}\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{module.exports.check = function check(stats, url) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you want a Puppeteer browser instance, add yet another argument {\ttfamily browser}. Your tests will be skipped on Node versions $<$ 6.\+4.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{module.exports.check = function check(stats, url, browser) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can export a function {\ttfamily skip} if you want to skip the test conditionally. The function should return a truthy value when the test should be skipped.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules4be3aa7967c2ad991b3caf64b30409c5_autotoc_md2578}{}\doxysection{Reference}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules4be3aa7967c2ad991b3caf64b30409c5_autotoc_md2578}
Any sub-\/directories of this directory are processed as follows\+:

Each sub-\/directory should contain a file called {\ttfamily webpack.\+config.\+js} which exports a standard Webpack configuration as default.

It can optionally contain a file called {\ttfamily test.\+js} with the following exports\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily check}\+: a function that will be invoked after Webpack compilation finishes successfully. It should return a Promise that resolves if the test succeeds and rejects if it fails. Synchronous tests can also return a non-\/promise value or throw.

The function can receive between zero and three arguments. The first argument, if needed, is the {\ttfamily stats} object that the Webpack compilation returns. The second argument, if needed, is the URL of a web server hosting the results of the Webpack compilation. The third argument, if needed, is a Puppeteer browser instance.

If the function accepts all three arguments, it will only run on Node $>$= 6.\+4 since that is the minimum requirement of Puppeteer. Therefore, don\textquotesingle{}t specify the third argument if you don\textquotesingle{}t need it so that your test can run on Node 4.

The web server will only be spun up if the function accepts two arguments or more. Therefore, don\textquotesingle{}t specify the second argument if you don\textquotesingle{}t need it so that your test runs faster.

If the {\ttfamily check} export is not present (or the whole {\ttfamily test.\+js} file is missing), a default check will be run. The default check ensures that there were no compilation errors, then loads {\ttfamily index.\+html} with Puppeteer and waits for it to log either {\ttfamily ok} or {\ttfamily error} to the console.
\item {\ttfamily skip}\+: a function that, if present, will be invoked without arguments. Its return code determines whether the test should be skipped (truthy return value means to skip the test, falsey means to run it.)
