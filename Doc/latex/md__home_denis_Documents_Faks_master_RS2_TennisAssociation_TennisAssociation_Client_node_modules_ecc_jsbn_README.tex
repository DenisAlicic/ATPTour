ECC package based on \href{https://github.com/andyperlitch/jsbn}{\texttt{ jsbn}} from \href{http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/}{\texttt{ Tom Wu}}.

This is a subset of the same interface as the \href{https://github.com/quartzjer/ecc}{\texttt{ node compiled module}}, but works in the browser too.

Also uses point compression now from \href{https://github.com/kaielvin/jsbn-ec-point-compression}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/kaielvin}}.
