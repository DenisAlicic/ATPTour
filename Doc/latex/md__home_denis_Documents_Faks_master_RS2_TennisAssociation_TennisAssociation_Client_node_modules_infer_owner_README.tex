This module endeavors to be as performant as possible. Parallel requests for ownership of the same path will only stat the directories one time.\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_infer_owner_README_autotoc_md26945}{}\doxysection{API}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules_infer_owner_README_autotoc_md26945}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path) -\/$>$ Promise$<$\{ uid, gid \}$>$}

If the path exists, return its uid and gid. If it does not, look to its parent, then its grandparent, and so on.
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path) -\/$>$ \{ uid, gid \}}

Sync form of {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path)}.
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner.\+clear\+Cache()}

Delete all cached ownership information and in-\/flight tracking.
