{\ttfamily source-\/map-\/loader} extracts existing source maps from all Java\+Script entries. This includes both inline source maps as well as those linked via URL. All source map data is passed to webpack for processing as per a chosen \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/}{\texttt{ source map style}} specified by the {\ttfamily devtool} option in \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/}{\texttt{ webpack.\+config.\+js}}.

This loader is especially useful when using 3rd-\/party libraries having their own source maps. If not extracted and processed into the source map of the webpack bundle, browsers may misinterpret source map data. {\ttfamily source-\/map-\/loader} allows webpack to maintain source map data continuity across libraries so ease of debugging is preserved.

{\ttfamily source-\/map-\/loader} will extract from any Java\+Script file, including those in the {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} directory. Be mindful in setting \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/\#rule-include}{\texttt{ include}} and \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/\#rule-exclude}{\texttt{ exclude}} rule conditions to maximize bundling performance.
