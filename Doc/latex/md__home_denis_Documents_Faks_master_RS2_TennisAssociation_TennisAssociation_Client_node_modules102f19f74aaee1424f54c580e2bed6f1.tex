Reads the {\ttfamily cmd-\/shim} located at {\ttfamily path} and resolves with the {\itshape relative} path that the shim points at. Consider this as roughly the equivalent of {\ttfamily fs.\+readlink}.

This can read both {\ttfamily .cmd} style that are run by the Windows Command Prompt and Powershell, and the kind without any extension that are used by Cygwin.

This can return errors that {\ttfamily fs.\+read\+File} returns, except that they\textquotesingle{}ll include a stack trace from where {\ttfamily read\+Cmd\+Shim} was called. Plus it can return a special {\ttfamily ENOTASHIM} exception, when it can\textquotesingle{}t find a cmd-\/shim in the file referenced by {\ttfamily path}. This should only happen if you pass in a non-\/command shim.\hypertarget{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules102f19f74aaee1424f54c580e2bed6f1_autotoc_md14944}{}\doxysubsection{read\+Cmd\+Shim.\+sync(path)}\label{md__home_denis_Documents_Faks_master_RS2_TennisAssociation_TennisAssociation_Client_node_modules102f19f74aaee1424f54c580e2bed6f1_autotoc_md14944}
Same as above but synchronous. Errors are thrown.
