Creates and initializes a new Angular app that is the default project for a new workspace.

Provides interactive prompts for optional configuration, such as adding routing support. All prompts can safely be allowed to default.

\item The new workspace folder is given the specified project name, and contains configuration files at the top level.
\item By default, the files for a new initial app (with the same name as the workspace) are placed in the {\ttfamily src/} subfolder. Corresponding end-\/to-\/end tests are placed in the {\ttfamily e2e/} subfolder.
\item The new app\textquotesingle{}s configuration appears in the {\ttfamily projects} section of the {\ttfamily angular.\+json} workspace configuration file, under its project name.
\item Subsequent apps that you generate in the workspace reside in the {\ttfamily projects/} subfolder.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you plan to have multiple apps in the workspace, you can create an empty workspace by setting the {\ttfamily -\/-\/create\+Application} option to false. You can then use {\ttfamily ng generate application} to create an initial app. This allows a workspace name different from the initial app name, and ensures that all apps reside in the {\ttfamily /projects} subfolder, matching the structure of the configuration file.
